I have a Phd in Physics and a strong background in complex systems and medical physics. I have working as a scholar but also in the private sector. I have strong experience developing practical tools in more than a dozens of programming languages. For the time being I work as a freelancer, mostly developing pipelines for Neuroimaging and Bioinformatics analysis in a HPC environment. Mainly a problem solver, I can do statistics with R, develop a parser with Perl or write a Python script to parallelise a data analysis.

I am the Neuroimaging and HPC manager for ACE Alzheimer Center Barcelona. I have implemented some innovative approaches related to dementia research. I develop and maintain a customized neuroimaging pipeline for ACE, focused on the automatization of tasks over a SLURM cluster. I mantain the XNAT platform for ACE neuroimaging as well as a bash client for interacting with XNAT. I also provide advice for parallelization of scientific applications into the HPC cluster. I maintain some public and private repositories where I develop software intended to work into parallelization environments.

Rigth now I'm looking into colaborations on HPC and bioinformatics. I'm active searching for some project were I can apply my abilities in process parallelization as well as my knowledge of linux scripting.
